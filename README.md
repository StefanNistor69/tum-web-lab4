# Laboratory Work Landing Page

This repository contains the landing page for my laboratory works. It serves as a hub for the various projects and experiments I've conducted as part of my coursework, highlighting key features such as the interactive mascot and responsive design.

## Interactive Mascot

The landing page features an interactive mascot, inspired by the iconic Microsoft Clippy, designed to engage visitors. It appears in the corner of the page after a short delay and, when hovered over, presents a friendly greeting message. This feature adds a unique and playful touch to the page, enhancing user experience.
